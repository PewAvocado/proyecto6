Tic Tac Toe

Inicio de mi proyecto tictactoe
Start of my new project of tictactoe


I started to do this proyect in Spanish, but while doing it, I found out that it is way better to do it
in full English, that is why at the middle of the proyect I changed the language.

From now on, all my proyects will be written in English, getting more used to it, with the different variables and such.

Also , personally this proyect has helped me to learn modules, factories, to never use global variables, and more sintax, yet I still need much more practice.
